# LiDARHostCompute project Overview
> LiDARHostCompute is a full-process debugging, analysis and visualization software tool for LiDAR devices, supporting device connection, point cloud data interaction and in-depth analysis through PC. Currently compatible with Windows 10/11 systems, it is planned to gradually expand to Linux/macOS platforms in the future. 

# Usage description
> When using the LiDAR, it is necessary to perform debugging and configuration of the device, preview point cloud data, and conduct data analysis. A host viewer is required for these purposes. Through the software, users and debuggers can conveniently view the quality of the point cloud data. They can also record, store, and replay the point cloud data, which facilitates subsequent use. Additionally, analyzing and processing the point cloud data can improve the efficiency of testing and validation.
